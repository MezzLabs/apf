TODO APF Refactor for use in Cloud9 IDE only:
------------------------------------------------------

Databinding/Propertybinding should never be bidirectional
    Implications:
    - Need to add the reciprocal binds in Cloud9 UI

IFDEF should be used for platform support NOT modularity

It should be easy to add non-apf widgets to the focus handler

It should be easy to use the property binding semantics to casual js objects



Phase 2
-------------------------

Models should work on JSON data

Widgets should operate on a virtual viewport

Databinding has too rigid requirements of the widget

The event system is not modular enough

The focus management is a mess
