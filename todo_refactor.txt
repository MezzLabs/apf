TODO APF Refactor for use in Cloud9 IDE only:
------------------------------------------------------

Databinding/Propertybinding should never be bidirectional
    Implications:
    - Need to add the reciprocal binds in Cloud9 UI

IFDEF should be used for platform support NOT modularity

It should be easy to add non-apf widgets to the focus handler

It should be easy to use the property binding semantics to casual js objects

Error reporting should be fixed and no single point of failure

Simplify data flows (data.js?)

Simplify layout.js

Simplify the elements:
    - Split complex elements in multiple simple ones
    - Remove features that are hardly used
    - Move specialty features to modules

Make sure all attributes that take IDs, also take REFs

Remove queuing, its overly complex.

Remove all element aliasses

Refactor actions to no longer be declarative. The actiontracker should simply 
provide an API to help execute and undo something if required.

Refactor binding rules to only be via attributes
    - Remove all binding elements except for those that should generate markup
    - Move binding column to just be column
    - Move dragdrop to be fully event based
    - etc

Deprecate AUTH. This should just be an event on the APP object

Deprecate the state element

Deprecate remote databinding
    Implications:
    - Need to use events instead for settings sync.
    Settings should have its own tree based API

Deprecate Teleport

Deprecate Defaults

Phase 2
-------------------------

Models should work on JSON data

Widgets should operate on a virtual viewport

Databinding has too rigid requirements of the widget

The event system is not modular enough

The focus management is a mess
